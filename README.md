Brad Weir's GitHub page
=========================

This is my GitHub page.

It uses the Jekyll theme based on [Freelancer bootstrap theme ](http://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/freelancer/).
The remainder of this file is the `README.me` file for the theme.

## How to use
 - Place a image in `/img/portfolio/`
 - Replace `your-email@domain.com` in `_config.yml` with your email address. Refer to [formspree](http://formspree.io/) for more information.
 - Create posts to display your projects. Use the follow as an example:
```txt
---
layout: default
modal-id: 1

project-date: January 2020
