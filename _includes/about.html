	<p>I'm a scientist that works at the Global Modeling and Assimilation
	Office at <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/goddard">NASA Goddard Space
	Flight Center</a> through the Goddard Earth Sciences and Technology
	(GESTAR) II cooperative agreement with Morgan State University. All
	views here are my own. My academic background is in applied
	mathematics. For about the past 30 years, my favorite toy has been a
	computer of some form. Most of my work applies some combination of
	math, stats, and computation to problems in Earth science. More
	biographical information can be found in the links below.</p>

	<p>This page houses and documents projects and code I've written both
	for work and personal interest. It is still obviously very much under
	construction. For example, project descriptions are still filled with
	theme templates.</p>
